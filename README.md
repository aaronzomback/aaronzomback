### Bonjour 👋 ☕️ 
I'm a <u> full stack engineer </u> currently specializing in Interactive Intelligence in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. I enjoy building and programming, but my true passion is storytelling and filmmaking. One of my career goals is to create immersive and dynamic educational gameplay experiences that'll inspire learning and curiosity about the world.
