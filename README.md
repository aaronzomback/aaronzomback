### Bonjour, je suis Aaron üëã ‚òïÔ∏è 

I'm a full stack engineer at [Bricks](https://www.bricks.co/) based in Montpellier, FR.

Experienced working with (but not limited to) Javascript, Typescript, GraphQL, Node, and Relational Db's. Currently studying part-time in Georgia Tech's Master of Computer Science program with an interest in networks, systems, and interactive intelligence.

I believe in a more decentralized future (Bitcoin) and that working with technology has ethical and social implications. Like the story of Icarus; we must be careful of not flying too close to the sun, but speed along at just the right altitude to avoid burning our wings.

When I'm not working on code, I like to experiment with photography/light projection as well as writing and making films.

## Favorite Technologies
‚Üí Javascript/Typescript
‚Üí React
‚Üí Node
‚Üí GraphQl & Apollo
