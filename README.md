### Bonjour, je suis Aaron üëã ‚òïÔ∏è 

I'm a full stack engineer at [Bricks](https://www.bricks.co/) based in Montpellier, FR.

Experienced working with (but not limited to) Javascript, Typescript, GraphQL, Node, and Relational Db's. Currently studying part-time in Georgia Tech's Master of Computer Science program with an interest in networks, systems, and artificial intelligence.

I value security, privacy, and a decentralized economy with Bitcoin.

Working with technology has ethical and social implications. Like the story of Icarus; we must be careful of not flying too close to the sun, but speed along at just the right altitude to avoid burning our wings.

When I'm not working on code, I like to experiment with photography/light projection as well as writing and making films.

#### Favorite Technologies
‚Üí Javascript/Typescript <br>
‚Üí React <br>
‚Üí Node <br>
‚Üí GraphQL & Apollo <br>
‚Üí Python
