### Bonjour, je suis Aaron 👋 ☕️ 

I'm a full stack engineer experienced working with Javascript, Typescript, Node, Express, GraphQL, React, and Ruby on Rails.

I believe that working with technology is a bit like the story of Icarus, we must be careful of not flying too close to the sun, but speed along at just the right altitude to avoid burning our wings. 

Currently specializing in Interactive Intelligence/AI as part of Georgia Tech's master of computer science program.
