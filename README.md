### Bonjour, je suis Aaron üëã ‚òïÔ∏è 

I'm a full stack engineer at [Bricks](https://www.bricks.co/) based in Montpellier, FR.

Experienced working with Javascript, Typescript, Python, Node, Express, GraphQL, React, and Ruby on Rails, as well as studying part-time in Georgia Tech's Master of Computer Science program.

I believe that working with technology has ethical implications, and so like the story of Icarus; we must be careful of not flying too close to the sun, but speed along at just the right altitude to avoid burning our wings.

When I'm not working on code, I like to experiment with photography/light projection as well as writing and making films.
